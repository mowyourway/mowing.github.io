{"name":"Mowing Services from MowYourWay","tagline":"Summer of 2015 Mowing Buisness","body":"### Welcome to MowYourWay Temporary Website!!\r\nThis is where if you are interested in the small local project of MowYourWay you can learn almost everything there is to know. You can see our current equipment and our schedule to help book a date for your appointment. NOTICE we are minors under the age of 18 so we have no current way to get out of the neighborhood that we are located. This means to say that if you got a flier you are in the clear for our services, if not please wait until either of us is able to travel to your location and we are sorry for the inconvenience.\r\n\r\n### Our Prices for Lawn Services\r\n```\r\n$30 for a single mow.\r\n$25 for a biweekly cancel-able contract (minimum of 6 weeks).\r\n$20 for a weekly cancel-able contract (minimum of 3 weeks).\r\n```\r\n\r\nALL PRICES ARE NEGOTIABLE.\r\n\r\n### Designer Templates\r\nWe've crafted some handsome templates for you to use. Go ahead and continue to layouts to browse through them. You can easily go back to edit your page before publishing. After publishing your page, you can revisit the page generator and switch to another theme. Your Page content will be preserved if it remained markdown format.\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at https://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
